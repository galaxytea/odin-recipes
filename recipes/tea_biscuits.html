    A lovely snack to go with afternoon tea, these aromatic and versatile biscuits can be made easily in minutes. Recipe makes about 12-15 biscuits.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g plain flour (low gluten)</li>
        <li>20g cornflour or tapioca starch</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li> 
        <li>40g white sugar or light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1-2 tbps tea leaves of your choice. Earl Grey is excellent.</li>
        <li>50g plant-based oil. Alternatively, one can use 30g melted butter and 25g oil for a slightly richer taste.</li>
        <li>1-3 tbsp milk or milk substitute</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using loose leaf tea, crush the tea leaves into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Combine the dry ingredients into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and vanilla extract to the bowl and combine well. Add milk as needed to help the dough combine.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a log shape and wrap in cling film. Chill in the freezer for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C (160C for fan-assisted ovens).</li>
        <li>Slice through the log to make approximately 12-15 disc shapes and place on a baking tray with around 2cm between each biscuit.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely before removing from the baking tray.</li>
    </ol>
